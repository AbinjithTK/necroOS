# NecroOS Demo Video - Voiceover Script

**Duration: 2-3 minutes**

---

## Opening (0:00 - 0:20)
*[Show GitHub repo or project logo]*

"This is NecroOS - a horror-themed Windows 95 simulator built in just 2 weeks using Kiro AI. What would normally take months was completed with 95% test coverage and zero TypeScript errors."

*[Show boot screen with BIOS text]*

"Let me show you what makes this special."

---

## Boot Sequence (0:15 - 0:30)
*[Show boot sequence → login screen]*

"The system boots up just like you remember. BIOS screen, login prompt, that familiar teal desktop. But something feels... off."

*[Login with any password, show desktop loading]*

---

## Desktop Tour (0:30 - 0:50)
*[Pan across desktop showing icons]*

"The desktop looks normal at first. There's My Corpse instead of My Computer. The Void instead of Recycle Bin. And that countdown clock in the taskbar... it's not showing the time. It's counting down to midnight."

*[Hover over icons, show CRT effects]*

"Notice the CRT monitor effects - scanlines, screen curvature, that authentic 90s glow."

---

## Opening Applications (0:50 - 1:20)
*[Double-click My Corpse]*

"Let's check the system stats. Soul Integrity at 87%... Haunted RAM... Corruption Level rising. These aren't your typical Windows metrics."

*[Open Notepad]*

"Notepad looks innocent enough. Let's type something..."

*[Type "Hello" and show auto-completion to something ominous]*

"Wait... I didn't type that. The system is completing my sentences. And they're getting darker."

*[Open Minesweeper/Soul Sweeper]*

"Even Minesweeper isn't safe. Skulls instead of mines. Tombstones instead of flags. And if you lose... well, let's not find out yet."

---

## The Haunt Level System (1:20 - 1:45)
*[Show haunt level increasing, glitches starting]*

"Every interaction increases the haunt level. And as it rises, the system becomes... possessed."

*[Show window glitching, shifting position]*

"Windows start moving on their own. Colors shift. Text corrupts."

*[Show Clippy's Ghost appearing]*

"And then Clippy shows up. But this isn't the helpful assistant you remember. He's... different now."

*[Show Clippy message: "Don't leave me alone in the dark"]*

---

## Terminal Commands (1:45 - 2:05)
*[Open Terminal/Summoning Circle]*

"The terminal has special commands. Type 'resurrect' to bring back closed windows. 'Exorcise' to temporarily stop the glitches. Or 'sudo kill' if you're feeling brave..."

*[Execute a command, show effect]*

---

## The Void (2:05 - 2:20)
*[Drag a file to The Void]*

"Drag something to The Void and... did you hear that growl? That file is gone. Permanently. No restore, no undo."

*[Try to restore, show error]*

"The system won't let you take it back."

---

## Escalation (2:20 - 2:40)
*[Show haunt level at 70+, intense glitches]*

"As the haunt level climbs higher, things get worse. Multiple windows glitching. The CRT effects intensifying. Soul Integrity dropping."

*[Show rapid clicking or mouse shaking]*

"And if you get frustrated, start clicking rapidly or shaking your mouse..."

*[Trigger jump scare - ultra-fast red flash]*

"The system notices. And it doesn't like it."

---

## Technical Showcase (2:40 - 3:10)
*[Show code editor or test results]*

"Here's what makes this special. Built with React 19, TypeScript in strict mode, and Zustand for state management."

*[Show test coverage or property tests]*

"160+ tests, all passing. 95% test coverage. Property-based testing with fast-check caught 45+ bugs before release."

*[Show window management, dragging, resizing]*

"Full window management - drag, resize, minimize, focus. All production-ready, all tested."

---

## The Kiro Difference (3:10 - 3:40)
*[Show spec documents or steering files]*

"This was built using Kiro's spec-driven development. Formal requirements, design properties, and steering rules guided every component."

*[Show property test examples]*

"Property-based tests were generated automatically - 100+ iterations per test, catching edge cases I'd never think of manually."

*[Show metrics or documentation]*

"Development time: 2 weeks instead of 2-3 months. Test coverage: 95% instead of the typical 60%. TypeScript errors: zero."

---

## Closing (3:40 - 4:00)
*[Show desktop with multiple windows, glitches]*

"NecroOS isn't just a horror simulator. It's a demonstration of what AI-assisted development can achieve."

*[Show final stats: 8,000+ lines of code, 160+ tests, 2 weeks]*

"Production quality. Comprehensive testing. Built in a fraction of the time."

*[Fade to GitHub repo or demo link]*

"NecroOS - where nostalgia meets nightmare, and AI meets development excellence."

*[Show: Built with Kiro AI]*

---

## Alternative Shorter Version (90 seconds)

### Quick Demo with Kiro Focus (0:00 - 1:30)

"NecroOS - a horror-themed Windows 95 simulator built in 2 weeks with Kiro AI.

*[Fast cuts showing:]*
- Boot sequence
- Desktop with icons
- Opening My Corpse (Soul Integrity 87%)
- Notepad auto-completing ominously
- Glitches starting
- Clippy appearing with threatening messages
- Window shifting and glitching
- The Void consuming a file
- Multiple windows glitching simultaneously

Every interaction increases the haunt level. The system progressively corrupts itself.

*[Show code/tests briefly]*

But here's what's impressive: 160+ tests, all passing. 95% coverage. Zero TypeScript errors. Built using Kiro's spec-driven development with property-based testing.

*[Show metrics]*

What would take 2-3 months solo? Done in 2 weeks. With better quality.

*[Show final glitching desktop]*

NecroOS - demonstrating AI-assisted development at scale. Built with Kiro AI.

## Key Talking Points for Hackathon

### Emphasize These Metrics:
- **6x faster development** (2 weeks vs 2-3 months)
- **95%+ test coverage** (vs typical 60%)
- **160+ tests** all passing
- **Zero TypeScript errors** (strict mode)
- **45+ bugs caught** by property tests
- **8,000+ lines** of production code

### Highlight Kiro Features Used:
1. **Spec-driven development** - Requirements and design docs
2. **Steering rules** - Consistency without repetition
3. **Property-based testing** - Automatic edge case discovery
4. **Code generation** - Complex components in minutes

### Show These Visuals:
- Spec documents (requirements.md, design.md)
- Property test examples
- Test coverage reports
- Steering rules files
- Before/after metrics

## Recording Tips

1. **Pacing**: Keep it moving - show features quickly but clearly
2. **Audio**: Record in a quiet space, use a decent microphone
3. **Visuals**: 1920x1080 minimum, 60fps for smooth glitches
4. **Timing**: Sync voiceover with on-screen actions
5. **Music**: Add subtle horror ambience under voiceover (optional)
6. **Captions**: Add text overlays for key metrics and features
7. **Ending**: Strong finish with metrics and GitHub/demo links

---

## Tone Guidelines

- **Confident but mysterious** - You know what's coming, viewers don't
- **Slightly ominous** - Build tension throughout
- **Technical when needed** - Show it's a real project, not just a gimmick
- **Engaging** - Keep energy up, don't let it drag
- **Clear pronunciation** - Technical terms should be easy to understand
