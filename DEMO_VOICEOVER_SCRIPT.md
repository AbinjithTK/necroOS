# NecroOS Demo Video - Voiceover Script

**Duration: 2-3 minutes**

---

## Opening (0:00 - 0:15)
*[Show boot screen with BIOS text]*

"Welcome to NecroOS - a Windows 95 simulator with a dark twist. What starts as nostalgic retro computing... doesn't stay that way for long."

---

## Boot Sequence (0:15 - 0:30)
*[Show boot sequence → login screen]*

"The system boots up just like you remember. BIOS screen, login prompt, that familiar teal desktop. But something feels... off."

*[Login with any password, show desktop loading]*

---

## Desktop Tour (0:30 - 0:50)
*[Pan across desktop showing icons]*

"The desktop looks normal at first. There's My Corpse instead of My Computer. The Void instead of Recycle Bin. And that countdown clock in the taskbar... it's not showing the time. It's counting down to midnight."

*[Hover over icons, show CRT effects]*

"Notice the CRT monitor effects - scanlines, screen curvature, that authentic 90s glow."

---

## Opening Applications (0:50 - 1:20)
*[Double-click My Corpse]*

"Let's check the system stats. Soul Integrity at 87%... Haunted RAM... Corruption Level rising. These aren't your typical Windows metrics."

*[Open Notepad]*

"Notepad looks innocent enough. Let's type something..."

*[Type "Hello" and show auto-completion to something ominous]*

"Wait... I didn't type that. The system is completing my sentences. And they're getting darker."

*[Open Minesweeper/Soul Sweeper]*

"Even Minesweeper isn't safe. Skulls instead of mines. Tombstones instead of flags. And if you lose... well, let's not find out yet."

---

## The Haunt Level System (1:20 - 1:45)
*[Show haunt level increasing, glitches starting]*

"Every interaction increases the haunt level. And as it rises, the system becomes... possessed."

*[Show window glitching, shifting position]*

"Windows start moving on their own. Colors shift. Text corrupts."

*[Show Clippy's Ghost appearing]*

"And then Clippy shows up. But this isn't the helpful assistant you remember. He's... different now."

*[Show Clippy message: "Don't leave me alone in the dark"]*

---

## Terminal Commands (1:45 - 2:05)
*[Open Terminal/Summoning Circle]*

"The terminal has special commands. Type 'resurrect' to bring back closed windows. 'Exorcise' to temporarily stop the glitches. Or 'sudo kill' if you're feeling brave..."

*[Execute a command, show effect]*

---

## The Void (2:05 - 2:20)
*[Drag a file to The Void]*

"Drag something to The Void and... did you hear that growl? That file is gone. Permanently. No restore, no undo."

*[Try to restore, show error]*

"The system won't let you take it back."

---

## Escalation (2:20 - 2:40)
*[Show haunt level at 70+, intense glitches]*

"As the haunt level climbs higher, things get worse. Multiple windows glitching. The CRT effects intensifying. Soul Integrity dropping."

*[Show rapid clicking or mouse shaking]*

"And if you get frustrated, start clicking rapidly or shaking your mouse..."

*[Trigger jump scare - ultra-fast red flash]*

"The system notices. And it doesn't like it."

---

## Technical Showcase (2:40 - 3:00)
*[Show code editor or dev tools briefly]*

"Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Zustand for state management. Property-based testing with fast-check. Over 95% test coverage."

*[Show window management, dragging, resizing]*

"Full window management - drag, resize, minimize, focus. All while the system is actively trying to corrupt itself."

---

## Closing (3:00 - 3:15)
*[Show desktop with high haunt level, multiple glitches]*

"NecroOS - where nostalgia meets nightmare. A fully functional Windows 95 simulator that progressively haunts itself."

*[Fade to black with countdown clock hitting 00:00]*

"Just don't let the clock reach midnight."

*[Optional: Show jump scare or BSOD effect]*

---

## Alternative Shorter Version (60 seconds)

### Quick Demo (0:00 - 1:00)

## Recording Tips

1. **Pacing**: Keep it moving - show features quickly but clearly
2. **Audio**: Record in a quiet space, use a decent microphone
3. **Visuals**: 1920x1080 minimum, 60fps for smooth glitches
4. **Timing**: Sync voiceover with on-screen actions
5. **Music**: Add subtle horror ambience under voiceover (optional)
6. **Captions**: Consider adding text overlays for key features
7. **Ending**: Strong finish with jump scare or midnight countdown

## Tone Guidelines

- **Confident but mysterious** - You know what's coming, viewers don't
- **Slightly ominous** - Build tension throughout
- **Technical when needed** - Show it's a real project, not just a gimmick
- **Engaging** - Keep energy up, don't let it drag
- **Clear pronunciation** - Technical terms should be easy to understand
